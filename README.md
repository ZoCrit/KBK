# Important notes

- Using KBK will overwrite the default functionality of the Function Keys you map it to
- If you have already created your own _hidutil_ custom bindings, using KBK will delete them (you will receive a warning message if this is the case)

# What is KBK?

Keyboard Brightness Key is a tiny CLI utility that allows you to remap the Keyboard Brightness Up and Keyboard Brightness Down back to the function row keys, as was the case with pre-M1 MacBooks.

# Why KBK?

- As of Monterey 12.3.1 this option is still missing from the native settings
- If you're only interested in mapping these specific keys, you might want to avoid installing larger-purpose apps that allow you to remap the entire keyboard
